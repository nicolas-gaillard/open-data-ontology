# open-data-ontology

## School project 

The objective of this mini-project is to manipulate semantic Web technologies through the creation of a small semantic application. It will be a question of collecting data, modeling them in RDF(S), interrogating them with SPARQL and finally offering some simple functionalities to end users through a Web application.
